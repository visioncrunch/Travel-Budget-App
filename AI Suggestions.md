What a great idea!

Creating a travel budget app to streamline group expenses is a fantastic concept. It's frustrating when everyone's
time is spent on calculating who owes what, instead of enjoying the trip or focusing on other important tasks.

To make your app a seamless experience, consider incorporating the following features:

3. **Expense sharing**: Allow users to share expenses within the group, making it easy to split bills, reimbursements, or calculate outstanding balances.
4. **Automated calculations**: Use algorithms to perform calculations for you, ensuring accurate totals and simplifying the process of figuring out who owes what.
6. **Real-time updates**: Allow users to see the current group balance, outstanding expenses, and individual account balances in real-time.
10. **Secure transactions**: Ensure that all financial transactions are secure, using encryption and reputable payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
